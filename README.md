Over the years, troubleshooting the root cause of connection problems has always given me headaches. It often required using multiple different tools and manually interpreting their results.

`conndoc` is a simple yet extensive command-line tool that aims to make connectivity diagnosis easier. It supports checks for ping, DNS, SSL, HTTP, and TCP, and provides a handy summary view.

## 🗺 Roadmap

Here are some planned and upcoming features for `conndoc`:

- **ICMP latency graph**  
  Show ping latencies over time as simple terminal plots.

- **Traceroute support**  
  Trace the path packets take through the network and measure latency at each hop.

- **Port scan (safe mode)**  
  Scan a set of common TCP ports to identify open services safely and quickly.

- **Save and export results**  
  Export diagnostics in JSON or Markdown format for easier sharing or CI integration.

- **Cross-platform packaging**  
  Add better support for Windows installers and Linux `.deb` / `.rpm` distributions.

- **Plugin support**  
  Let users extend Conndoc with custom checks that integrate into the summary view.
